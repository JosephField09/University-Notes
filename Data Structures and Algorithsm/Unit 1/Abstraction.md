[[Unit 1]]

 An object is an abstraction 
	- The precise details of how it works are irrelevant to the user
	
- Abstraction does not eliminate the details, it just confines them to the minimum scope necessary. 

- A java interface acts as an abstraction of a class because its method are abstract and hence contains no implementation detail.
