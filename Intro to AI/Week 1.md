 [[Introduction to AI]]
AI is the part of computer science concerned with design of computer systems that exhibit human intelligence.

Four categories of AI:

- Thinking humanly:
	- To build a machine that thinks like a human
	- A cognitive modelling approach
	- e.g. the General Problem Solver
		- 1956 
		- Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon 
		- Designed to solve any problem that could be presented in the form of mathematical formulas
	
- Thinking Rationally:
	- How to build programs that represent the "right thinking" to create intelligent machines
	- "Right thinking" is defined in coding using logic or laws of thought
	- Borrows from Aristotle's right thinking
	
- Acting humanly:
	- The first proposal for success in building a program and act humanly was the Turing Test.
		- Alan Turing (1950) proposed an operational test for intelligence, if it can fool a human interrogator.
		- To be considered intelligent a program must be able to act sufficiently like a human to fool an interrogator
		
	- To act humanly the computer must:
		- Understand and generate language (Natural language processing)
		- Know about the world (Knowledge representation)
		- Reason about the world (automated reasoning)
		- Learn about the dialogue and the interrogator (machine learning)
		- combine all this knowledge and reasoning instantaneously

- Acting Rationally:
	- To act so as to achieve one's goals, given one's beliefs
	- A rational agent is one that perceives its environment and acts so as to achieve the best outcome or when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.
	- AI can be viewed as the study and construction of rational agents
	- e.g. Self driving cars


Foundation of AI:
	- Philosophy:
		- At the time, the study of human intelligence began with no formal expression
		- Initiate the idea of mind as a machine and its internal operations
	- Mathematics:
		- Formal representation and proof, algorithms, computation, decidability, tractability, probability
		- Probability contributes the "degree of belief" to handle uncertainty in AI
		- Division theory combines probability theory and utility theory
	- Psychology:
		- The study of human reasoning and acting
	- Linguistics:
		- For understanding natural languages
		- Formal languages
		- Syntactic and semantic analysis
		- Knowledge representation
	- Neuroscience:
		- Physical substrate for mental activity
	- Control theory:
		- Stability, simple optimal agent designs
	- Computer engineering:
		- Provides the artifact that makes AI application possible
		- The power of computer makes 


Major AI Technologies:
	- Robotics:
		- A reprogrammable, multifunctional manipulator made to move materials, parts, tools or specialised devices. 
		- Robots are machinery designed to carry out a variety of tasks
	- Natural language processing:
		- Analysis of natural language and speech
			- Chatbot
			- Speech technologies like Siri
		- Machine translation of human languages
			- Google translate
	- Machine computer vision
		- object and face recognition
		- Image classification
	- Machine Learning:
		- Gives the computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
		- e.g. AlphaGo
	- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
		- A neural network is a series of algorithms that aim to recognise underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain works
		- Deep learning is a neural network with a series of hidden layers of non-linear operations between input and output
	- Generative AI
		- Learns the underlying set of data and generates new data that closely mimics the original data
		- Mainly used to make new content like text, images or music that is similar to what humans would create.


Limitations of AI:
- Lack of creativity
- Bias in data
- Limited Understanding
- Dependency on Data Quality
- Ethical Concerns
- High Costs
- Job Displacement
