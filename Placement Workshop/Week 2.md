Typical Timeline:
1) Think through your options and book an appointment
2) Create a CV and have it checked through CV360
3) Complete a cover letter/application form
4) Use interview360 to complete a Mock interview
5) Secure your placement
6) Let careers know you have secured a placement, in order to start the approvals process


- Use aston futures to find them
- Grad Cracker has STEM placements


Tips:
- Check weekly
- Apply early
- Look at everything
- Be curious
- Make lots of applications


Types of application:
- Responsive: You apply in response to a placement being advertised
- Speculative: You approach an organisation or contact, explain that you are looking for a placement, and ask if they would consider employing you


DO use a wide range of websites in support of search
DO make both responsive and speculative decisions
Do your research
DO use a variety of search terms
ALWAYS tailor your applications to the employer and role

DON'T apply with generic C.V's - inefficient approach and waste of time
DON'T leave placement search to last minute

AI can support you, but are not you
